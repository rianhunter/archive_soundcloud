National Security Cinema: 
This is a book about secrecy, militarism, manipulation, and censorship at the heart of the world’s leading democracy—and about those who try to fight them. Using thousands of pages of documents acquired through the Freedom of Information Act National Security Cinema exclusively reveals that the national security state—led by the CIA and Pentagon—has worked on more than eight-hundred Hollywood films and over a thousand network television shows. The latest scholarship has underestimated the size of this operation, in part because the government has gone to considerable lengths to prevent data emerging, especially in the 21st Century, as the practice of government-Hollywood cooperation has escalated and become more aggressive. National Security Cinema reveals for the first time specific script changes made by the government for political reasons on dozens of blockbusting films and franchises like Transformers, Avatar, Meet the Parents, and The Terminator. These forces have suppressed important narratives about: CIA drug trafficking; illegal arms sales; military creation of bio-weapons; the interaction of private armies and oil companies; government treatment of minorities; torture; coups; assassinations, and the failure to prevent 9/11.

Dr. Matthew is a Teaching Fellow at the University of Bath in England. His doctoral thesis applied Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky’s Propaganda Model to the contemporary Hollywood film industry. His first book, Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy, was published by Pluto Press in 2010 and has since been translated into Chinese. In 2014, Dr. Alford produced a documentary film of his research, The Writer with No Hands, which premiered at Hot Docs in Toronto and won the Tablet of Honor at the Ammar Popular Film Festival in Tehran.

Tom Secker is a private researcher who runs spyculture.com— the world’s premier online archive about government involvement in the entertainment industry. He has used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain unique government documents since 2010, which has been reported on by Russia Today, Salon, Techdirt, The Mirror, The Express and other outlets. He has authored and co-authored articles for Critical Sociology and the American Journal of Economics and Sociology and hosts the popular ClandesTime podcast."

The film is masterfully structured in such a way that it starts as a typical film about an artist, who a group of people believe more people should know. Comics who were given opportunities thanks to him or have memories of his early work appear on screen. Goldthwait then hits the audience with information about a horrific experience from Crimmins’ childhood, and the film is instantly transformed into something incredible...His brash wit and knowledge of current events produce material that still is edgy today. His material is inspired by a motivation for peace and justice...It is refreshing to know there are people in the world of comedy like Barry."" - Kevin Gosztola on Shadowproof.com

Instead of making Barry go through the plot of 'Call Me Lucky', we spend most of the time talking about the state of the modern comedy scene & how the Reagan-era never ended.

Is it possible that even someone as ridiculous as Trump could be a 'victim' of the intentionally racist script we were indoctrinated with on the day of 9/11 itself?  Why were there 3 separate mainstream media stories between 9:40am and 1:30pm on the day of 9/11 itself that placed blame on Palestinian terrorist groups for the attacks? Robbie tries to answer all these questions and more in this solo episode of Media Roots Radio.

Despite repeated government pledges to close the infamous detention facility down, 149 men remained indefinitely imprisoned there.

According to a Bush administration official, the vast majority of prisoners are innocent, and were either swept up in a dragnet or handed over in exchange for US bounties.

It's already hard enough to travel to Gitmo as a journalist, but upon arrival I realized the experience was going to be totally controlled, with 24/7 military official escorts preventing us from going near the detainees I had come to report on.

However, I was able to speak with several top brass who serve as defense attorneys for the military commissions, a corrupted system that grants alleged terrorists less rights than in civilian courts. The fact that six men are facing formal charges at the prison in relation to 9/11 & the USS Cole bombing gives the world the false impression that even alleged terrorists get their day in court. In reality, the remaining 143 men never charged with a crime may never get that luxury.

My brother Robbie interviewed me about the trip, which is a more personal account than presented on Breaking the Set.

Most people who became politically aware, or 'woke up' after 9/11 might wrongly assume that warrantless wiretapping, rendition of terror suspects, the formation of the homeland security agency and predator drones were spearheaded by the Bush administration.

Yet the framework for the 'War on Terror' was actually put into place by President Clinton. Not only did Clinton have several opportunities to either capture or kill Bin Laden, but in the year prior to leaving office, he was warned with eerily similar Presidential Daily Briefs (PDBs) to Bush about imminent US plane hijackings. Throughout out the 90s, the Taliban also rose to power with the help of the Pakistani ISI, Unocal, the CIA and Enron.

Abby & Robbie Martin do the first Media Roots Podcast since Abby made international headlines for her off-script remarks opposing the Russian / US involvement in Crimea. They discuss the corporate media hijacking the message to further demonize Russia and outline how an influential DC think-tank called the Foreign Policy Initiative (or FPI) was directly involved in smearing her and RT as a tool to ""rally"" the people into the brink of a new Cold War. 

All roads lead to a tightly knit 'hip' and 'young' group of hardcore neoconservative DC players who place themselves in 'millennial' publications like the Daily Beast, Daily Banter and Buzzfeed to push insidious neoconservative propaganda that derives from William Kristol's Foreign Policy Initiative. 

James Kirchick is not only a senior fellow for (and the sole prominent journalist of) the FPI, but he also used to be an employee of a US funded 'white propaganda' radio network that spreads Pro US military and policy views to adversarial nations in regional languages (i.e.: they broadcasted pro US military propaganda in arabic in Iraq during the Iraq war).

As Abby and Robbie were figuring out what was going on as her 'stand' was being hijacked and subsequently smeared by war mongering neocons, the television show 'House of Cards' started to seem like total non-fiction.

Gravel endorses the 9/11 Ballot Initiative movement across the country, saying the measure would create a ""citizens commission rather than a government commission"" with subpoena power against top U.S. officials to ""make a true investigation as to what happened"" regarding the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Paglen’s visual work has been exhibited at several art museums worldwide and his writing and art have been published in major publications including The New York Times, Wired, Vanity Fair and Newsweek. Paglen holds a B.A. from UC Berkeley, an M.F.A. from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and a Ph.D. in Geography from UC Berkeley, where he remains an affiliated researcher.

In the 90s, Paglen was a member of a locally revered bay area noise/experimental project called Noise Gate, and co-ran an infamous underground venue in downtown Oakland called the Sandcrawler. His electronic music background hugely inspired co-host Robbie Martin in his own musical evolution.

Paglen is also the author of several books: Torture Taxi, the first book to comprehensively cover the CIA's extraordinary rendition program; I Could Tell You But Then You Would Have to be Destroyed by Me, a book looking at the world of black projects through unit patches and memorabilia created for top-secret programs; and Blank Spots on the Map: The Dark Geography of the Pentagon's Secret World, a book that gives a broader look at secrecy in the United States.
