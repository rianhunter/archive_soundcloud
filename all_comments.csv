The real blame should be placed on the Venezuelan government. Over the last +20 year PDVSA has been managed so terribly that oil production in 2017 is expected to be at a 23 year low. Instead of investing in even basic maintenance, the government has instead used every dollar of oil revenue to support the local populace in an effort to stay in power. While on hand PSVU should be commended for trying to support the most venerable sector of Venezuelan society, on the other hand the government has completely destroyed the economy through excessive debt and poor management of its natural resource sector."

The fact that it has no written constitution is largely a formality since it has had a system of legal precedent/conventions and acts of parliament (e.g. Bill of Rights of 1689) that has worked quite well for a very long time compared to other “democracies”. Canada did not get its own constitutional independence until 1982 but it worked quite well up until then.

Yes, the cost of living is way beyond the quality of life provided by the minimum wage. Unfortunately, if the minimum wage is raised, the pace of technological unemployment will be expedited. And at some point, not necessarily now (but not necessarily not now), we will find ourselves in a situation in which the cost of living is beyond the scope of whatever the current minimum wage happens to be at the time - but raising the minimum wage would usher in mass technological unemployment. No idea when that will be, not saying that will necessarily be the case with $15/hr, bur the dichotomy between raising the minimum wage or not will be outdated at some point if not soon.

If people took a minute to look they would know that you never supported Trump but a minute, in this ADD world is too much to ask. They simply conclude that based on your great work tearing apart Hillary you must support Trump. This simple, inadequate analysis shows why it's so easy for the main stream media to manipulate people. I understand why some people voted for Trump but don't get why so many did and honestly, who the fuck voted for Hillary? She's a ridiculous criminal. This was the time for the people to finally say no to the two party dictatorship, instead people fell for it again. Who knows what's gonna happen with the war's, but the neocon's are not the type of people to simply give up. More likely they'll do whatever it takes."

Unfortunately, they didn't turn out in large numbers.  For example, here in New York State where i reside, only 14% made the effort to make sure they would be able to vote and voted.  The youth need to get their act together.  Each and every one of them, without exception, needs to stop what they are doing and put their life on hold and become well-informed individuals, free of misinformation and disinformation, and get actively involved in the political process to usher in a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.  If only 80% of the youth ever decide to become well-informed and vote, then we will have a progressive President, a progressive Senate and House, and a progressive Supreme Court."

Trump is trailing Hillary Clinton by just 5 points, according to the latest NBC/WSJ poll, released this morning. Worse still: When the horserace is expanded to four candidates -- including Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein – Clinton’s lead drops to just 1 point (she gets support from 39 percent of voters, Trump gets 38 percent, Johnson 10 percent and Stein 6 percent).  Moreover, Hillary may be indicted over her emails and/or for election fraud.  If you do not nominate Bernie Sanders, you will be increasing the chances of a Trump win in November.  If that happens, it will be on your heads."

My truncated translation would be that as Americans climb the ladder of personal gains, at some point, we’re all faced with the doing the right thing, which often leads to taking one [or multiple] steps back down the ladder. The bigger the truth, the greater the fall, raw capitalism dictates this. When faced with the choice, most simply are not willing to lose their position. When the society moves this way, no conspiracy is needed. It will create the “proper” outcome on its own. Who needs a cabal when everyone’s position on the ladder is more important than the greater good?"

In the past, this exclusion of not being accountable for the content inside the accessed networks meant, that access provider like your AT&T could not be prosecuted for providing access to unlawfully content.

This law was banned in 2010 by the federal constitutional court or supreme court and ruled against on European Level by the EUCHR in 2014. 2) The reshaping of the telecommunications law, to include  ""endangering services"", that basically says, that if you can not be aware of contents of your customers (like due the use of encryption), your services becomes an ""endangering service"".

I let you have a guess what is that one thing.othervise, both harris and dawkins thing very simmilar to you, they are liberals, and they say you are not a liberal because you support the political/religious (That is one of the problems of islam, that needs to be reformed - it's not just religion is both religion and law and form of government) movement"

And I do agree, that yes, there might be a pinch of socioeconomical issues too, but mostly it is what they themselves say it is - belief that they are doing the right thing, that will grant them a passage to a magical land called heaven, because a magical book says so. And that's it. If you take away the magical book and the legend, those people might be normal peope as you and I are.

The insensitivity afterward by those seeking to sensationalize it for personal reasons, is truly offensive. Republicans are using it as an immigration issue; not addressing the fact. that it's Republican's who completely stonewalled any attempt at legitimate immigration reform.  In America, we call ourselves a ""Free"" Country, but the truth is so far from that platitude.

You can therefore guarantee that the worst possible outcomes will come about. Or, you can take the other position. You can say: 'Look, maybe something will work.

All lives matter regardless of class, culture, geographical region, or even species. No life is isolated as one must depend on another for existence. Not being able to come to terms with this is the root of everything that is wrong with the world. People are different in certain aspects; psychologically in nature and physically in relation to where one is geographically born or acclimated to. That, however, is why we have names. To classify a certain person for the aspects associated to them that are different from another. Not every group of individuals is the same, and not every person is either, but we are all human."

I would argue that by continually labeling darker skin tones or lighter skin tones to color, it continually segregates humans from each other. Biologically speaking, we are all one race: the human race. Any other concept to (human) race is just a social context, which means it's a misunderstanding that is widely believed. By stating people are black or white it leads false evidence, whether subconsciously or consciously, to the social context that humans are fundamentally different. This is a notion that must be accepted in order for capitalism to continue, as disparity and inequality are the foundations to its economic structure."

You should raise awarness of the status of women, gays, free speach etc in countriesl like UAE, but this can not be a basis for invasion. Many european countries have problems with muslim traditions of female genital mutilations, horour killings etc. Basically, your good old saudi spread and financed wahhabism - and this is a problem, but IMHO you have to deal with the causes, not the symptoms. First, ban Saudis from any international politics till they start acting like grown people. Stop supporting them and all the other similar monarchies and dictators. Well.. that would be a start.

You do understand that not all brown people are muslim, and that you don't have to be brown to be muslim. Are _you_ a racists, if you criticize capitalism?

Not a vague afterlife, or the wishy washy afterlife crystal wielding hippies believe in - no, the afterlife that you can go directly if you die killing infidels, or defending your religion, or your flavour of religion (most victims of islamic terrorism are muslim people). This is extremely bad. Again, nothing the west can do about this - this has to be done by musslim people themselves.

You can't play a 'oh no, it's just an allegory' card as reformed religions can.

227211636,198968736,2015/04/06 01:35:32 +0000,2612,WF74,"I have read many convincing reports that Bin Laden died many years before the farcical ""burial at sea"". He was purposely allowed to escape during the battles of Tora Bora in Dec 2001 because of a high command stand down order. He lived for a short time in Pakistan where he was being treated for kidney disease. He died in Pakistan during or before 2003. The ENTIRE killing of Bin Laden saga that occurred in 2011 was a staged event. The most despicable part of the story is the killing of our own Seal Team members. The traitors in our military and gov't are deathly afraid of possible repercussions from their own highly trained soldiers."

Medusa's asexual head full of gossip-snakes has been around for some time. I would like to see a report on how the innocent are raped with smears, lies, and destroyed, but it would be boring to those who believe in vendettas and revenge. There is no justice in media smears until after a court legally evaluates the event. Perry Mason-Gunsmoke-Barbie Doll-Hefner paradigms for evaluating our social experiences and what to expect of each other are too piss-poor to be credible. Licensed, educated brothels and sex positive culture centers take the appeal out of rape and sexual abuse, but will not eliminate it without close scrutiny.

Time to break them tn this century because i want to walk on Mars in my lifetime so hurry up mankind ... get your shit together :D

And that is the backline of it - and this works and splits system critics against you - people do believe the deeply rooted left right split and associations - that is how opposition is destroyed. And to create news out of nothing by setting false news about beeing harrassed - no one cares if created or not it is created to be shared and to smear, split and so on. People in power structures try to find anything and ... so on. The problem is, when the line beind this thing is anti-russian it has the potential to re-associate older paradgimes to it: dictatroship, socialism, anti-americanism and so on. This has - been seen also in your case - the potential to hugely split social critics and activist later on - it is a polarisation line which will be grwoing and is long term used - nothing new I guess."

Liz Wahl thing is the attempt of spinning someting out of it - not always really successfull - but whatshowever - and see, the spin also adresses Russia - not only Russia Today and by that - at least in the short run able to create anger and negative fallout to finish system-critics-shows and so on .... this than is not only a media-spin - it could have gotten really heated as russian-backbone is also bound by things .... so the spin is not to be laughed at - as it is rooted in long term goals of disabling critical voices by whatever mean and if you can get anger or non-support between your show and russian hosts (?) ... this is good old divide, polarise and cause anger and devision spin also causing trouble with peace convinction and russias perspective and goals ...."
169939739,140562685,2014/03/23 03:03:22 +0000,1104999,Klaus-Dieter Hinck,Well - hard to question then if system-critics are in the defence mode for Greenwald or the results of the way of the leaks - well depending on the way and direction if criticism. Who could I be to criticise as I did not take the danger and so on - but who am I not to question normalisation coming out of leaked things piece by piece and people accpeting surveillance through this? I would not blame Greenwald or bash him - it would be ridicoulus ... well whatshowever .... I still miss criticism in the whole branch of alternative media - in this case defeind Greenwald against mainstream smashin - which is good - but not caring about what time does to world-citicens who will accept NSA when .... and so on .... maybe I am wrong but psychologically the amount of things leaked and the time period is a problem and a dilemma as it also has done a good work in changing minds - seen in the case of Syria and american opposition - but when the mainstream focsu switches as it has done - the chances of change out of leaks gets to ZERO in some days ... cu
169939035,140562685,2014/03/23 02:56:27 +0000,986333,Klaus-Dieter Hinck,Well this seems like a typical content media storm to destroy you as a brand and to instrumentalise everything - hope some conservative defended you and your stand as content. These spins are sometimes stupid or seem to be - but as they are massive they damage and burn person-brands and trustability. They also give appearance and publicitiy - but still damage as we we say in germany - always something sticks if you throw (?) *** at people ....
169938323,140562685,2014/03/23 02:50:03 +0000,441811,Klaus-Dieter Hinck,Interesting things from Glenn Greenwald - maybe hiring people one day. But beware of trends or direction getting your thing away from the way you are on. As Omidyar is somehow to be seen critical - if this will once be an option to be hosted american rooted. Delete this comment if damaging or unwanted - just my thoughts. I would see Greenwalds reaction also in context of saying hello to a possible co-worker. And if independance is garanteed .... well not my business - but my thought - maybe of interest or value. The result of normalisation by the piece by piece leak - besides all ... blablabla .... see debate which will hopefulle start once #corbettreport and whatever .... according to the Crimea-Trip ..... well I guess it would haver been fun to do peace activism between the serbian russian self defence  ... :-]
169937569,140562685,2014/03/23 02:43:23 +0000,221285,Klaus-Dieter Hinck,Russia is not stupid. RT shows are hosted differently set up. Still a strong stand and good move. Somehow damaging and disagreed in the item but a proof for independance and for that valuable - for Russia. I guess Putin smiles about that. In a good mood.

Sex negative messages from religion and from society have contributed (Madonna / whore) but I don't feel sex has much to do with it really. Look at the sexist misogynist comments directed at Abby on social media. Men constantly commenting on her appearance and so forth. I saw one today about Abby on Youtube which was very unfortunate saying she was masturbabion material. Men don't have to endure this kind of disrespect and objectification and certainly not in the same way that women do.  It's not wonder we have epidemic levels of violence against women today.

The longer the conflict the more higher the profit earnings for defense contractors.

The Revolutionary United Front rebels in Sierra Leone had been widely – and rightly – condemned for their brutality against civilians, which included amputations and rape. But what most actors – including the major ‘players’ in the international community – seemed to be missing was just how pervasive was the complicity of a variety of powerful actors in the rebellion that they claimed to be opposing or suppressing."

Nor can the information that used to be up there be found today, at all.  I know raids have happened, etc., but there should be mirroring, etc., and the lack of old info, some of which you'd find SO useful for your show, makes me feel that somehow or other, wikileaks may have been compromised.

You get your back to the ropes, you offer your chin, you let him hit you lightly, lean back into the rope, then bounce back with not only all of your strength, but the strength of him and yourself pushing into the rope and then flinging you back at him with a hit that is way more than you could ever pull off by just standing in the middle of the ring and swinging."

Whether they're ""in"" on it, or simply falling prey to the idea that others have placed in their heads, they somehow believe the government should have things like a Dillon Aero minigun SUV in the president's motorcade, and will use that and similar devices responsibly all the time, and that without a badge or uniform, that law-abiding individuals are somehow unworthy of safely owning and employing semi-automatic, mid-calibre firearms until such time as the collective shit hitting the fan, as it were."

96743409,76876218,2013/02/05 01:34:50 +0000,1476825,Pongoid,"So... here we have the dilemma.  We know that the study of geoengineering is real.  You say you are aware that the US has used cloud seeding techniques in warfare.  Those were... chemtrails.  I'm not saying that the vapor-trails people see nowadays are anything but vapor, or that if someone was altering the atmosphere that anyone would even see it or recognize it as such, but rather that the possibility that such an event could occur is very real.  Some have even mentioned the idea using geoengineering to create a clouding of the skies to reduce the effectiveness of photovoltaic cells and increase humanity's dependence on non-reknewable energy sources."

The gangsters are doofuses, but the law abiding gun owners are NOT wackos.

Lyrics: 
Well I live with snakes and lizards 
and other things that go bump in the night 
'Cuz to me everyday is Halloween 
I have given up hiding and started to fight 
I have started to fight 
Well any time, any place, anywhere that I go 
all the people seem to stop and stare 
they say 'Why are you dressed like it's Halloween? 
you look so absurd, you look so obscene' 
Oh, why can't I live a life for me? 
why should I take the abuse that's served? 
why can't they see they're just like me 
it's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world 
well I let their teeny minds think 
that they're dealing with someone who is over the brink 
and I dress this way just to keep them at bay 
'Cuz Halloween is everyday 
it's everyday
Oh, why can't I live a life for me? 
why should I take the abuse that's served? 
why can't they see they're just like me 
it's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world 
Oh, why can't I live a life for me? 
why should I take the abuse that's served? 
why can't they see they're just like me 
i'm not the one that's so absurd 
why hide it? 
why fight it? 
hurt feelings 
best to stop feeling hurt 
from denials, reprisals 
it's the same it's the same in the whole wide world"
